# Spring Boot
Overview of the Spring Boot framework and its applications.

## What is Java Spring Boot?

Java Spring Framework (Spring Framework) is a popular, open source, enterprise-level framework for creating standalone, production-grade applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities:

- Autoconfiguration
- An opinionated approach to configuration
- The ability to create standalone applications

These features work together to provide you with a tool that allows you to set up a Spring-based application with minimal configuration and setup.

### Autoconfiguration
Autoconfiguration means that applications are initialized with pre-set dependencies that you don't have to configure manually. As Java Spring Boot comes with built-in autoconfiguration capabilities, it automatically configures both the underlying Spring Framework and third-party packages based on your settings (and based on best practices, which helps avoid errors). 

### Opinionated approach
Spring Boot uses an opinionated approach to adding and configuring starter dependencies, based on the needs of your project. Following its own judgment, Spring Boot chooses which packages to install and which default values to use, rather than requiring you to make all those decisions yourself and set up everything manually.

### Standalone applications
Spring Boot helps developers create applications that just run. Specifically, it lets you create standalone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server, by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process. As a result, you can launch your application on any platform by simply hitting the Run command.
